<h1> SQL course </h1>

Repository consists of materials related to introductory SQL (MySQL) course on Udemy. Exercises were done during lectures on my own, then assessed by comparing to technical solution of the lecturer and numerical results.
Final project mostly consists of similar types of tasks, plus they were extended and changed it bit, it seems. Followed up on this course by taking the intermediate, second course on this topic (see the repo).
